# NN-with-Regulization&Dropout

### What we want you to remember from this notebook:
Regularization will help you reduce overfitting.
Regularization will drive your weights to lower values.
L2 regularization and Dropout are two very effective regularization techniques.


**Here are the results of our three models**:

Note that regularization hurts training set performance! This is because it limits the ability of the network to overfit to the training set. But since it ultimately gives better test accuracy, it is helping your system.
